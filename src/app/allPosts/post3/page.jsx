        blogPost_heading4="2. Gentle Soap and Water Solution"
        blogPost_text4="For routine cleaning, a mild soap and water solution work wonders. Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Dampen a soft cloth in the solution, wring it out well, and gently wipe down the plywood surfaces. Be cautious not to oversaturate the wood, as excess moisture can lead to swelling."

Choose a polish specifically designed for wood furniture and apply it in moderation."

        blogPost_heading8="6. Protect from Sunlight and Humidity"
